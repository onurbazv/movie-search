# Movie Search App

This simple react app will interact with an API from the website TheMovieDB (need to attribute them on footer) to search for things related to the film industry (movies, tv shows, series, actors, directors, etc)



## To Do List

- [X] Integrate search functionality to the page
- [X] Create component for listing preview
- [X] Prev/Next page buttons
- [X] Create genres array constant
- [ ] Open detailed information in a modal when clicking a preview component

## Next Up & Bugs
Modify current modal to use a single modal for all components (instead of creating one modal for each preview component), and setting the correct component inside the modal (as state ?) when clicking the preview, then clearing it when the modal closes.

Creating a FullMedia component for each different type of "media" (tv/movie/person) and render on modal on click
